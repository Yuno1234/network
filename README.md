## Description
A Twitter Clone, where users can post, edit, and like posts. They can also see other users' profiles and follow them. Users can view posts from people they follow in the image provided. The goal of this project was to create a single page application using vanilla JavaScript and Django. I learned how to use different request methods besides GET and POST and had difficulty displaying different elements based on user authentication and the app's state. However, after completing the project, the I gained a better understanding of web development and felt more confident in my skills.
